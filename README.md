# Sugar Candy login theme for SDDM on NixOS

This is a fork of the Sugar Candy login theme for SDDM made by Marian Arlt
available
[here](https://framagit.org/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-candy/-/tree/master).

This fork aims to provide a NixOS module to customize the theme using its
impressive number of variables as well as a package to install it at your
convenience.

## Installation

To install it you **must have flake enabled** and your NixOS configuration
**must be managed with flakes.** See [https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for
instructions on how to install and enable them on NixOS.

Next, you can add this flake as inputs in `flake.nix` in the repository
containing your NixOS configuration:

```nix
inputs = {
  # ---Snip---
  sddm-sugar-candy-nix = {
    url = "gitlab:Zhaith-Izaliel/sddm-sugar-candy-nix";
    # Optional, by default this flake follows the latest nixpkgs-stable.
    # ---
    # Note that setting this will make it follow your version of nixpkgs, which
    # can lead to issue if you lock it to nixpkgs-unstable. If you don't add this
    # line, the derivation will be bigger, but will work Out Of the Box.
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
  # ---Snip---
}
```

This flake provides an overlay for Nixpkgs, a package and a NixOS module. They
are respectively found in the flake as
`inputs.sddm-sugar-candy-nix.overlays.default`,
`inputs.sddm-sugar-candy-nix.packages.${system}.default` (Where `${system}` is either
`x86_64-linux` or `aarch64-linux`) and
`inputs.sddm-sugar-candy-nix.nixosModules.default`.

Here is a simple example on how to install both the overlay and the module in
your NixOS configuration:

```nix
outputs = { self, nixpkgs, sddm-sugar-candy-nix }: {
  # replace 'joes-desktop' with your hostname here.
  nixosConfigurations.joes-desktop = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
    system = "x86_64-linux";
    modules = [
      sddm-sugar-candy-nix.nixosModules.default
      # ---Snip---
      # Add your own modules here
      # ---Snip---

      # Example to add the overlay to Nixpkgs:
      {
        nixpkgs = {
          overlays = [
            sddm-sugar-candy-nix.overlays.default
          ];
        };
      }
    ];
  };
};
```

> [!WARNING]
> This flake follows the latest stable version of Nixpkgs. This
>does not mean it necessarily follows the latest commit of Nixpkgs Stable.  You
>may want to override it by setting `inputs.nixpkgs.follows` in your flake
>input, however this flake **is not tested with unstable**.
>
>Do it at your own risk.

## Caveats

My knowledge with Nix and NixOS is limited and as such the module and package
are imperfect. Hence, there are some caveats to take into considerations:

1. Due to the nature of the theme, its configuration lives in `theme.conf`. As
   such the module will override the derivation to create a new `theme.conf`
   containing your configuration leading to **a complete rebuild and download of
   the theme**. I advise you to run `nix-collect-garbage` when testing some
   configurations of the theme as it will steadily fill up your Nix store.

If you have any idea on how to fix these issues, please, feel free to make a
Pull Request. Thank you ðŸ’•

## Configuration

The sugar series is **extremely customizable** by setting the options in the
module. You can change the colors and images used, the time and date formats,
the appearance of the whole interface and even how it works.
And as if that wouldn't still be enough you can translate every single button
and label because SDDM is still lacking behind with localization and clearly
[needs your help](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki/Localization)!

After installing the module, Sugar Candy can be configured by setting its
configuration options in the given module:

```nix
{ lib, ... }:

{
  services.displayManager.sddm = {
    enable = true; # Enable SDDM.
    sugarCandyNix = {
        enable = true; # This set SDDM's theme to "sddm-sugar-candy-nix".
        settings = {
          # Set your configuration options here.
          # Here is a simple example:
          Background = lib.cleanSource ./background.png;
          ScreenWidth = 1920;
          ScreenHeight = 1080;
          FormPosition = "left";
          HaveFormBackground = true;
          PartialBlur = true;
          # ...
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

Below are the configuration options, with their default values, available in
the module. They cover **every single option** the theme provides by default.

`Background = ./Backgrounds/Mountain.jpg;`
*Path to the image. In flake evaluation, must be used with `lib.cleanSource` to
set it as store path to keep purity. Most standard image file formats are
allowed including support for transparency. (e.g.
background.jpeg/illustration.GIF/Foto.png/undraw.svgz)*

`DimBackgroundImage = 0.0;`
*Double between 0 and 1 used for the alpha channel of a darkening overlay. Use
to darken your background image on the fly.*

`ScaleImageCropped = true;`
*Whether the image should be cropped when scaled proportionally. Setting this
to false will fit the whole image instead, possibly leaving white space. This
can be exploited beautifully with illustrations (try it with "undraw.svg"
included in the theme).*

`ScreenWidth = 1440;`
`ScreenHeight = 900;`
*Adjust to your resolution to help SDDM speed up on calculations.*

`FullBlur = false;`
`PartialBlur = false;`
*Enable or disable the blur effect; if `HaveFormBackground` is set to true then
`PartialBlur` will trigger the `BackgroundColor` of the form element to be partially
transparent and blend with the blur.*

`BlurRadius  =  100;`
*Set the strength of the blur effect. Anything above 100 is pretty strong and
might slow down the rendering time. 0 is like setting false for any blur.*

`HaveFormBackground  =  false;`
*Have a full opacity background color behind the form that takes slightly more
than 1/3 of screen estate; if `PartialBlur` is set to true then `HaveFormBackground`
will trigger the `BackgroundColor` of the form element to be partially transparent
and blend with the blur.*

`FormPosition  =  "center";`
*Position of the form which takes roughly 1/3 of screen estate. Can be left,
center or right.*

`BackgroundImageHAlignment = "center";`
*Horizontal position of the background picture relative to its visible area.
Applies when `ScaleImageCropped` is set to false or when `HaveFormBackground` is
set to true and `FormPosition` is either left or right. Can be left, center or
right; defaults to center if none is passed.*

`BackgroundImageVAlignment = "center";`
*As before but for the vertical position of the background picture relative to
its visible area.*

`MainColor = "white";`
*Used for all elements when not focused/hovered etc. Usually the best effect is
achieved by having this be either white or a very dark gray like #444 (not black
for smoother anti-alias). Colors can be HEX or Qt names (e.g.
`red`/`salmon`/`blanchedalmond`). See
[https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-color.html](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-color.html)*

`AccentColor = "#fb884f";`
*Used for elements in focus/hover/pressed. Should be contrasting to the
background and the `MainColor`to achieve the best effect.*

`BackgroundColor = "#444";`
*Used for the user and session selection background as well as for `ScreenPadding`
and `FormBackground` when either is true. If `PartialBlur` and `FormBackground` are
both enabled this color will blend with the blur effect.*

`OverrideLoginButtonTextColor = "";`
*The text of the login button may become difficult to read depending on your
color choices. Use this option to set it independently for legibility.*

`InterfaceShadowSize = 6;`
*Integer used as multiplier. Size of the shadow behind the user and session
selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background.
Initial render can be slow for values above 5-7.*

`InterfaceShadowOpacity = 0.6;`
*Double between 0 and 1. Alpha channel of the shadow behind the user and session
selection background. Decrease or increase if it looks bad on your background.*

`RoundCorners = 20;`
*Integer in pixels. Radius of the input fields and the login button. Empty for
square. Can cause bad antialiasing of the fields.*

`ScreenPadding = 0;`
*Integer in pixels. Increase or delete this to have a padding of color
`BackgroundColor` all around your screen. This makes your login greeter appear as
if it was a canvas.*

`Font = "Noto Sans";`
*If you want to choose a custom font it will have to be installed globally in
your NixOS configuration.*

`FontSize = "";`
*Only set a fixed value if fonts are way too small for your resolution.
Preferably kept empty. Beware, the font size in string, not an integer.*

`ForceRightToLeft = false;`
*Revert the layout either because you would like the login to be on the right-hand side or SDDM won't respect your language locale for some reason. This will
reverse the current position of `FormPosition` if it is either left or right and
in addition position some smaller elements on the right-hand side of the form
itself (also when `FormPosition` is set to center).*

`ForceLastUser = true;`
*Have the last successfully logged-in user appear automatically in the username
field.*

`ForcePasswordFocus = true;`
*Give automatic focus to the password field. Together with `ForceLastUser` this
makes for the fastest login experience.*

`ForceHideCompletePassword = false;`
*If you don't like to see any character at all not even while being entered set
this to true.*

`ForceHideVirtualKeyboardButton = false;`
*Do not show the button for the virtual keyboard at all. This will completely
disable functionality for the virtual keyboard even if it is installed and
activated in `sddm.conf`*

`ForceHideSystemButtons = false;`
*Completely disable and hide any power buttons on the greeter.*

`Locale = "";`
*The time and date locale should usually be set in your system settings. Only
hard set this if something is not working by default, or you want a separate
locale setting in your login screen.*

`HourFormat = "HH:mm";`
*Defaults to `Locale.ShortFormat` - Accepts `"long"` or a custom string like
`"hh:mm A"`. See [http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html)*

`DateFormat = "dddd, d of MMMM";`
*Defaults to `Locale.LongFormat` - Accepts `"short"` or a custom string like
`"dddd, d 'of' MMMM"`. See [http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html)*

`HeaderText = "Welcome!";`
*Header can be empty to not display any greeting at all. Keep it short.*

*SDDM may lack proper translation for every element. Sugar defaults to SDDM
translations. Please help translate SDDM as much as possible for your language:
[https://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki/Localization](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki/Localization). These are in order as they
appear on-screen.*

- `TranslatePlaceholderUsername = "";`
- `TranslatePlaceholderPassword = "";`
- `TranslateShowPassword = "";`
- `TranslateLogin = "";`
- `TranslateLoginFailedWarning = "";`
- `TranslateCapslockWarning = "";`
- `TranslateSession = "";`
- `TranslateSuspend = "";`
- `TranslateHibernate = "";`
- `TranslateReboot = "";`
- `TranslateShutdown = "";`
- `TranslateVirtualKeyboardButton = "";`

*These don't necessarily need to translate anything. You can enter whatever you
want here.*
